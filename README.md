Mod-Installer-From-URL
======================
This does exactly as it says. Download The MIFU.vbs and the Modlist.txt or create your own!

The Modlist.txt MUST be as follows:

  -each line represents a mod
  
  -there are 2 parts to each line separated by a comma
  
  -the first part is the EXACT link to the mod download
  
  -the second part is where it will be saved to

Thats All!
